# PaddleBall by Sayham Chowdhury

In our paddle ball game, the ball moves around the display, bouncing off walls just as in the Pong game. 
The player controls a paddle trying to hit the ball just like in the Pong game. If the ball hits the paddle, 
it bounces off and continues on its way. The main difference in our game is that if the player misses the ball, 
the ball simply bounces off the wall behind the paddle and continues to travel. There is no scoring in this game.
